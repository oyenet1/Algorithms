## Problem Solving skills

`A good approach to problem solving are listed below, most of the solution are adopted from` **_George Plya_** `book titled` **_How to solve it_**

1. Understanding the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

### 1. Understanding the problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the input that goes into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come out of the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem.

### 2. Explore concrete examples

- start with simple example
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore example with empty input
- Explore examples with invalid input

### 3. Break it down

- Determine inputs
- Computaions
- Edge cases
- Output

### 4. Solve and simplify

<!--
- Solve the problem if you can't then
- Solve simpler problem
- **Simplify** -->

- Find the core dificulty in what you are trying todo
- Temporary ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplify solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

### 5. Look back and refactor

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for another problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other way to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?

## How to tackle problem

- **Device** a plan for solving the problem
- **Master** common problem solving pattern

### Some patterns

1. Frequency Counter
1. Multiple pointers
1. Sliding window
1. Divide and Conquer
1. Dynamic programming
1. Greedy Algoriyhm
1. Backtracking etc.
